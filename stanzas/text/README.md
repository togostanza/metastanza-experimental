# Text

A stanza for displaying text. It supports both plain text format and Markdown format.

## About `highlight-css-url` parameter

Specifies the style for syntax highlighting of code when in markdown mode. This stanza uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) internally, so you can specify any URL as long as it is a CSS URL that conforms to its specification.

To find a fitting theme for your project, the [highlight.js demo](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) is useful.

It may be easier to use the style files provided by highlight.js via CDN, see "Fetch via CDN" section on [How to use highlight.js
](https://highlightjs.org/usage/).
